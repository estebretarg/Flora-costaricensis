# Flora-costaricensis

Flora costaricensis is a professional botanical identification tool for plant species present in Costa Rica.

It was designed for botanists, dendrologists, forestall engineers, agronomists or other plant related fields.

This tool intend to help researchers and other environmental sciences professionals to complete or advance projects faster. Accelerating the conservation efforts and at the same time contributing to the environmental agenda. Also it will be a great learn tool for students.

Imagine make a forestall inventory in a fraction of a time with an accurate census of species. 

It is an easy to use tool with interactive and settable dichotomous keys based on the descriptions and keys from the "Manual de Plantas de Costa Rica" ("Handbook of the Plants of Costa Rica") <a href= "README.md/#Bibliography:" target = "_self">*refer to bibliography</a>* 

# Desired features:
<ul>
  <li>Settable workspaces based on parameters (elevation, humidity, life zone, family, genus, ...etc.).</>
  <li>Main "global" environment to explore all plants from Costa Rica.</>
  <li>Select a species and track the hierarchy (inverse search).</>
  <li>Pin favorite species and store them on customizable file sets.</>
  <li>Include extensive and detailed characteristics for each species.</>
  <li>If the species has cultural or industrial usages it will be marked whit an icon-based symbology.</>
  <li>Attach own photos to the species and compare them with global public data bases.</>
  <li>Make geo-references when you successfully identify a specie with the app contributing to the distribution maps</>
</ul>
  If you are interested in suggest more features please contact me from the contact information on my Github profile.
  
# Challenges:
<ul>
  <li>The species names are changing constantly due to advanced ADN research.</>
  <li>The financial support: open source does not mean die of starvation. <br><br>We need to find interested institutions who can support the project and get recognition of the public as green-nature interested companies.</>
</ul>

# Methodology:

Species are stored as objects in JSON format, for easy recognition and easy edition due to the constant investigation in taxonomy, highly active in Costa Rica.
